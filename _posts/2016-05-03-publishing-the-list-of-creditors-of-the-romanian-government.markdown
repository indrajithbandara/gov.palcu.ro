Today ANAF, the Romanian IRS, is going to publish the list of the creditors who have debt more than 1.5k lei to the [budgets](http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Economie/Stiri/LISTA+RUSINII+DATORNICI+ANAF+PUBLICATA). The information will appear on [data.gov.ro](https://data.gov.ro/dataset/datoriile-catre-bugetul-de-stat) and I will have to [scale](https://github.com/govro/datagovro/issues/43) and cache parts of the website, so it keeps up with the whole traffic.

08:41am - This has been getting [lots of press coverage](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=lista%20datornicilor&src=typd) early in the morning. We are still waiting for the ANAF president to sign the release of the data.
