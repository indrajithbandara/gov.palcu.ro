Recently, I had to make a simple script that creates a new dataset and uploads a resource to it. I had to demo the functionality for somebody who is going to upload lots of datasets soon. I thought that it might take only 10 minutes, but it took me well over 2 hours to get it finished.

It's open source [on Github](https://github.com/govro/ckan-api-upload-example) and [here](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/2944) is the follow-up issue for CKAN.
